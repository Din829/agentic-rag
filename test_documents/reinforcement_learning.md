# Reinforcement Learning: Learning Through Interaction

## What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. Unlike supervised learning, RL doesn't require labeled data; instead, the agent learns from the consequences of its actions.

## Core Components

### The RL Framework
1. **Agent**: The learner or decision maker
2. **Environment**: The world the agent operates in
3. **State (s)**: Current situation of the agent
4. **Action (a)**: What the agent can do
5. **Reward (r)**: Feedback from the environment
6. **Policy (π)**: Strategy for choosing actions
7. **Value Function (V)**: Expected future reward from a state

### The RL Loop
1. Agent observes current state
2. Agent selects an action based on policy
3. Environment transitions to new state
4. Environment provides reward signal
5. Agent updates policy based on experience
6. Repeat until goal achieved

## Fundamental Concepts

### Exploration vs Exploitation
- **Exploration**: Trying new actions to discover their effects
- **Exploitation**: Using current knowledge to maximize reward
- **ε-greedy**: Common strategy balancing both
- **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**: Optimistic exploration
- **Thompson Sampling**: Probabilistic exploration

### Markov Decision Process (MDP)
Mathematical framework for RL problems:
- **Markov Property**: Future depends only on current state
- **Transition Probability**: P(s'|s,a)
- **Reward Function**: R(s,a,s')
- **Discount Factor (γ)**: Importance of future rewards

## Classic RL Algorithms

### Value-Based Methods

#### Q-Learning
Off-policy TD control algorithm:
- Learns action-value function Q(s,a)
- Updates: Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
- Converges to optimal Q-function

#### SARSA
On-policy TD control algorithm:
- Similar to Q-learning but follows current policy
- Updates based on actual next action taken

### Policy-Based Methods

#### REINFORCE
Monte Carlo policy gradient method:
- Directly optimizes policy parameters
- Uses complete episode returns
- High variance but unbiased

#### Actor-Critic
Combines value and policy methods:
- Actor: Learns policy
- Critic: Learns value function
- Reduces variance of policy gradient

## Deep Reinforcement Learning

### Deep Q-Network (DQN)
Breakthrough combining deep learning with Q-learning:
- Neural network approximates Q-function
- Experience replay for stability
- Target network for convergence
- Successfully played Atari games

### Advanced DQN Variants
- **Double DQN**: Reduces overestimation bias
- **Dueling DQN**: Separate value and advantage streams
- **Rainbow**: Combines multiple improvements
- **Prioritized Experience Replay**: Samples important transitions

### Policy Gradient Methods

#### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Clips policy updates for stability
- Widely used in practice
- Good balance of performance and simplicity

#### Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
- Constrains policy updates
- More complex but theoretically motivated
- Guarantees monotonic improvement

#### Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
- Maximum entropy framework
- Encourages exploration
- State-of-the-art for continuous control

## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
