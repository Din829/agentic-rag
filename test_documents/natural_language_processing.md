# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Overview

Natural Language Processing is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way. It combines computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning models.

## Core NLP Tasks

### Text Processing
1. **Tokenization**: Breaking text into words, phrases, or symbols
2. **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root form
3. **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Identifying grammatical roles
4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying persons, places, organizations
5. **Dependency Parsing**: Analyzing grammatical structure

### Text Analysis
1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining emotional tone or opinion
2. **Topic Modeling**: Discovering abstract topics in documents
3. **Text Classification**: Categorizing text into predefined groups
4. **Information Extraction**: Extracting structured information from unstructured text

### Text Generation
1. **Machine Translation**: Translating between languages
2. **Text Summarization**: Creating concise summaries
3. **Question Answering**: Responding to natural language queries
4. **Dialogue Systems**: Building conversational AI

## Traditional NLP Techniques

### Bag of Words (BoW)
Simple representation of text that disregards grammar and word order but keeps multiplicity.

### TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
Statistical measure to evaluate word importance in a document relative to a collection of documents.

### N-grams
Contiguous sequences of n items from a given text, useful for language modeling and text prediction.

### Word Embeddings
- **Word2Vec**: Creates vector representations capturing semantic relationships
- **GloVe**: Global Vectors for Word Representation
- **FastText**: Extension of Word2Vec that considers character n-grams

## Modern NLP with Transformers

- Bidirectional context understanding
- Fine-tuning for specific tasks
- Variants: RoBERTa, ALBERT, DistilBERT

### GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
- Autoregressive language modeling
- Few-shot learning capabilities
- GPT-3, GPT-4: Large-scale language models
- Applications: Text generation, code completion, creative writing

### T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
- Unified framework treating every NLP task as text-to-text
- Flexible architecture for multiple tasks
- Strong transfer learning capabilities

## Future Directions

1. **Multimodal NLP**: Combining text with images, audio, and video
2. **Cross-lingual Models**: Universal models for multiple languages
3. **Efficient Models**: Smaller, faster models with comparable performance
4. **Explainable NLP**: Understanding model decisions
5. **Ethical AI**: Addressing bias and fairness in language models
